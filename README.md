# Day Today
A simple script that prints out the weather, date, and time, that can be launched at login or system startup.

## Usage
There are any number of uses for the script, but it is most helpful when launching a terminal emulator or at TTY login prompt.
It is in no way necessary, but it is pretty and somewhat useful.

## Install
The script will install into `/usr/local/bin` for easy launching, without touching `$PATH`.
```
git clone https://github.com/N3WK1D/day-today.git
cd day-today
sudo make install
```
